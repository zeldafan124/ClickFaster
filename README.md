# ClickFaster

ClickFaster is a simple autoclicker! To use it, click "ClickFaster.zip" and download it! Extract the files, and open "ClickFaster.exe". 
Because Autoclickers need to access your mouse (to click), you'll need to allow it through the Windows Defender smartscreen. Just click "Allow", and enjoy your awesome auto click for fun games!
